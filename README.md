 Develop an image classification model to recognize different types of food items from images.
Steps:
Data Collection: Collect a dataset of food images categorized into various classes.
Data Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and split data into training and testing sets.
Model Architecture: Choose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture like VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet.
Transfer Learning: Use a pre-trained model and fine-tune it for your specific food classification task.
Model Training: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy and other relevant metrics on the test dataset.
Visualization: Visualize model predictions and explore misclassified images.
